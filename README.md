Modules for use with [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/)

## Currently in development:

Module that triggers based on user defined phrase length and bar length
Aim of the module is to provide users the ability to automate modules in VCV
Rack and keep them in time. 

Triggers will be armed by the user. The triggers will produce an ouput on the
start of a phrase or bar.

Possible use cases would be to start a sequencer or mute a track by arming
the trigger before the start of the next phrase or bar.
